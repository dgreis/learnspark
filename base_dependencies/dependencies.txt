## Dependencies To Download:
## 	(to create base spark image)


- spark-2.0.2 (http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html) 
	* (Select Source Code)
- zeppelin-0.6.2-bin-all.tgz (https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html) 
	* (I didn't use zeppelin, but you can; the docker image will have it.)

Put these in this folder before building base-spark image. FYI, it takes a while to build Spark from source.
